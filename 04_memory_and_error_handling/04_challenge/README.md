# Challenge 4

Create a function `element_at` that takes a `std::vector<int>` and an integer index as its arguments. The function should return the element of the vector at the specified index. If the index is out of bounds, throw a `std::out_of_range` exception with a suitable error message. In the main function, call `element_at` with both valid and invalid indices, handling the exception appropriately.
